TwitchTracker

If running from source, start by installing node-webkit. Download this software and run "npm install" to download the dependencies.

Modifing the Looks
==================

So you don't like my talented design? Well, really, it's a direct rip from the tutorial http://www.fiveminuteargument.com/blog/scrolling-list.

Any case, if you haven't already guessed it's all HTML/CSS based. 

As long as you have a ul with and id="u10" somewhere in the index.html file it'll work.

Oh, and you can modify the ui.css file in ./css as well to change the look.

Chroma Key
==========

If you want to play with chroma key, there is an example ui-chroma.css file in the css directory. Just change the css file in the index.html file to point to this to get started.
